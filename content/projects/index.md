**Bracket-Gen**  
<!-- [GitHub Repository]()    -->
**Technologies used:** *Node.js, Express, MongoDB*   
*A prediction reinforcement learning model*  
<br>  
Currently working on a full-stack project using Python and React predicting brackets for March Madness Tournaments from historical data. The project consisted of head-to-head team analysis based on past performance meeting minimum requirement score post-normalization. To provide more accurate prediction, I web scraped 12 additional factors using Selenium to obtain more data for classification. Created a random forest classifier to make 72% accurate predictions on validation data.
