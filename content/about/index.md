I’m the Head Teaching Assistant for The Data Mine at Purdue.

I’m currently interning in the Platform team at Zylo.

I will be graduating from Purdue in May 2024 with a BS in Computer Science and BS in Statitics (Data Science) and a minor in Economics.

In the Platform team, I created platform user archivql and unarchival features using Node.js and created test suites with Mocha. I also implemented a key data clarity feature for clients which consisted of setting up an AWS cloudwatch listner and an eventbridge that trigger a lambda to update the status for nightly integration runs. In addition, I worked on 2 P1 and 4 P2 critical security vulenrability tickets found in annual pentest.

As the Head TA for the Data Mine's seminar courses (TDM 10100-40100), I supervise a team of 40 undergraduate TA's and train them with the necessary tools to provide the best assistance for 1200+ students in the Data Mine.
