<br>  

I worked to optimize spatial intersection operations of NOAA's GeoJSON dataset containing over 9 million records of block-level census data with spatial flood inundation maps for 400 dams using GeoParquet. The optimized codebase was executed using Apache Spark job queues on Purdue's Anvil High-performance Computing cluster with Dask library to enable ease of processing.

<br>   

In the Platform team, I worked on 2 P1 and 3 P2 critical security vulnerability tickets found in annual penetration test. I also implemented a key data clarity feature for clients which consisted of setting up an AWS EventBridge with filter rules that trigger a lambda function to update the status for nightly integration runs. In addition, I created platform user archival and un-archival features using Node.js and created test suites with Mocha.
